# Examples

Some nice examples of scholarly publishing on the Web that we may want to be inspired by:

* [Paper on PeerJ](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-34/)
* [Paper on F1000](http://f1000research.com/articles/3-176/v1)
* [Paper Plos One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144297)

The [Utopia Project's demo](http://utopiadocs.com/demo/) shows a number of inspiring possibilities, although that is based on PDF an not on HTML.
