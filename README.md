# THIS REPOSITORY IS NOW CLOSED!

The bids for new-style proceedings of the Web Conference XX (formerly known as WWW20XX) has now been closed, and IW3C2 is now in the phase of contractual negotiations. However, the [bid requirement document](https://iw3c2.github.io/proceedings/Bid/index.html) is left in the repository; other conference may follow suite, and may want to reuse some of the ideas in that document.

The original content of the README file:

> ## WWW Proceedings
> Repository for the discussion on new-style online proceedings of the WWW conferences. The discussions should lead to a Web-friendly proceedings, maintained by IW3C2 for the WWW2018 conference onwards.
>
> This discussion does *not* affect the proceedings to be published for the WWW2017 conference.
