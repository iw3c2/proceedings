It is organized by the <a href="http://iw3c2.org">International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee (IW3C2)</a> and aims to provide the world with a premier forum for discussion and debate about the evolution of the Web, the standardization of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture. The conference brings together researchers, developers, users and commercial ventures—indeed all those who are passionate about the Web and what it has to offer. Over the years the academic track of the conference has become one of the most prestigious venues for researchers all over the world to publish their research results; the proceedings of the conference is indexed and highly ranked by all tools and organizations that measure academic performances. The conference takes place every year in April-May time and its location changes every year. In the past few years we have seen the conference at such different places as Seoul, Florence, Montréal; the venues for 2017 and 2018 will be Perth and Lyon, respectively.            </p>            <p>                The proceedings of the conference, containing all the peer-reviewed academic papers, contains around 120 academic papers, published in digital form only. Although the conference is <em>not</em> and ACM conference, the publication is done by the ACM and it is therefore part of the ACM digital library. This publication setup is based on a contract between the ACM and IW3C2; this contract expires after the publication of the conference in Perth in 2017.            </p>            <p>                A sligthly unusual feature of the agreement with the ACM is that the copyright of <em>all</em> papers is held by the IW3C2 and <em>not</em> by the ACM. IW3C2 has the right to publish the proceedings on its own Web site, and it indeed does that through an open access policy. As an example for a proceedings you can look at the <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/forms/proceedings.htm">proceedings of the WWW2016 conference</a> held in Montréal.            </p>        </section>        <section>            <h2>Description of the bid</h2>            <p>                As referred to in the introduction, IW3C2 needs a new contract to publish the conference proceedings starting from the proceedings of <a href="http://www2018.org/">WWW2018</a>, to be held in Lyon, France, in April 2018. In order for the paper submission process of the conference to provide the right publishing information to prospective authors, this means a contract between the publisher and IW3C2 must be in place in the autumn of 2017. To achieve this, IW3C2 should make a final choice of the new publisher at its general meeting at the beginning of April, 2017. To leave enough time for internal discussion, final proposals from publishers should be in the hand of IW3C2 <em><strong>by the end of February of 2017</strong></em>.            </p>            <p>                IW3C2 wants to use this opportunity to radically renew the presentation of its proceedings. Simply put, the proceedings of the conference should fully embrace the possibilities of the Web, and adapt to the new realities of the scholarly publishing process and offerings. This means a list of requirements that a new type of proceedings should fulfill; details of these requirements are <a href="#reqs">listed below</a>. IW3C2 is of course open to intermediate discussions between issuing this bid and the submission deadline to possibly discuss some of the details and provide clarifications.            </p>            <section id="reqs">                <h3>Publishing requirements</h3>                <p>                    The requirements are grouped into three categories:                </p>                <ol>                    <li><a href="#req-papers">Requirements for the individual papers</a></li>                    <li><a href="#req-procs">Requirements for the proceedings as a whole</a></li>                    <li><a href="#req-authors">Requirements for the worfklow of paper submittors</a></li>                </ol>                <p>                    For each of these requirements are grouped into absolute, strong, and “nice to have” requirements. Absolute requirements are those that IW3C2 wants to see fulfilled in any case. The other two are not necessarily deal breakers, but may differentiate bids among themselves.                </p>                <section id="req-papers">                    <h4>Requirements for individual papers</h4>                    <section>                        <h5>Absolute Requirements</h5>                        <ul>                            <li>Each paper has its own DOI</li>                            <li>The papers should be under open access of some sort (preferably, under CC0-BY copyright)</li>                            <li>Articles available in valid and accessible HTML5                                <ul>                                    <li>Extra resources like extra CSS or JavaScript, as well as embedded materials like figures, images, video or audio <em>must</em> be stored locally on the system alongside the paper itself.
