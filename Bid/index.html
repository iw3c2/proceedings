A successful        bidder is expected to sign a contract with IW3C2 for a period of five        years, starting in 2018. The bid should be submitted <em><strong>by the            end of February of 2017</strong></em> with the goal of signing the        contract by the autumn of of 2017. The bid should include: </p>      <ul>        <li>a timetable for the authors and the conference organizers (e.g., how          many weeks before the start of the conference should all contributions          be submitted to the publishers to have the proceedings on-line at the          event);</li>        <li>itemize any fees that might be payable by the conference;</li>        <li>how the publisher would fulfill the detailed requirements, as <a href="#reqs">described
            in a separate section below</a>.</li>      </ul>      <p>Bids should be submitted by email to the <a href="mailto:publishers@iw3c2.org">publishers@iw3c2.org</a>        mailing list.</p>    </section>    <section>      <h2>Background</h2>      <p> The Web Conference series (i.e, WWW2014, WWW2015, etc.) is the prime        yearly international conference on the topic of the future directions of        the World Wide Web. </p>      <p>The series started in 1994 at CERN, when the main creators and        developers of the World Wide Web decided to hold a regular event to help        moving the Web forward. The <a href="http://iw3c2.org">International          World Wide Web Conferences Committee (IW3C2)</a> was formed to        maintain the series of events, and it has been doing it ever since. The        conference series aim to provide a premier forum for discussion, debate,        and research on the evolution of the Web, the standardization of its        associated technologies, or the impact of those technologies on society        and culture. The conference brings together researchers, developers,        users, and commercial ventures—indeed all those who are passionate about        the Web and what it has to offer. The peer-reviewed paper track of the        conference has become one of the most prestigious venues for researchers        all over the world to publish their research results in the field; the        proceedings of the conference is indexed and highly ranked by all tools        and organizations that measure academic performances. The conference’s        location rotates among the Americas, Europe, and Australasia and its        events usually span a period of five days, and takes place in the        April-May periods. In the past few years the conference was held in        Seoul, Florence, and Montréal; the venues for 2017 and 2018 will be        Perth and Lyon, respectively. See the <a href="http://www.iw3c2.org/conferences">the
          list of all the conferences</a> on the site of IW3C2.</p>      <section>        <h3>Current Proceedings</h3>        <p> The proceedings of the conference, containing all the peer-reviewed          academic papers, includes around 120 academic papers, published in          digital form only (i.e., printed proceedings are not produced).          Although the conference is <em>not</em> an ACM conference, the          publication is part of the ACM digital library. The publication is          based on a contract between the ACM and IW3C2; this contract expires          after the publication of the conference proceedings of the event in          Perth in 2017. </p>        <p> The agreement with the ACM is such that the copyright for <em>all</em>          papers is held by the IW3C2 and <em>not</em> by the ACM. IW3C2 has          the right to publish the proceedings on its own Web site, and it          indeed does that. The IW3C2 version of the proceedings is made          available through an open access policy; IW3C2 publishes the articles          under a CC BY 4.0 license (see the <a href="http://www.www2017.com.au/perch/resources/iw3c2copyrightform-20160623.pdf">IW3C2
            Copyright Release Form</a> for further details on these          arrangements). </p>        <p>As an example for a proceedings you can look at the <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/forms/proceedings.htm">proceedings
            of the WWW2016 conference</a> held in Montréal. </p>      </section>      <section>        <h3>Alternate Proceedings</h3>        <p>The Web Conference is a 5 day event that also includes tracks that          are not part of the peer-reviewed academic track. Examples are          tutorials, workshops, sessions on special topics, etc. Some of these,          typically workshops, have their own organizers with their own          peer-review system and also intend to provide their own proceedings.          Individual workshops may choose their own publication approaches, but          there is an informal agreement between the ACM and IW3C2 to publish          those proceedings, if the organizers of a particular workshop so          desire, through the ACM. These are <i>not</i> part of the          conferences’ main proceedings, and form what is referred to as          “alternate proceedings”, often published as a “companion volume”.</p>        <p><i>This request for bids focuses on the core, technical track            proceedings only</i>. However, publishers should also tell IW3C2          whether they are open for such, possibly one-off, year-by-year          agreements with individual conferences to publish companion volumes          with workshops who wish to publish their proceedings following          essentially the same setups as the main publication. This has been the          case for several workshops for past conferences.</p>      </section>    </section>    <section>      <h2>General Description</h2>      <p> As referred to in the introduction, IW3C2 needs a new contract to        publish the conference proceedings starting from the proceedings of <a          href="http://www2018.org/">WWW2018</a>,        to be held in Lyon, France, in April 2018. In order for the paper        submission process of the conference to provide the right publishing        information to prospective authors, a contract between a publisher and        IW3C2 must be in place in the autumn of 2017. Therefore, to leave enough        time for internal discussion, final proposals from publishers should be        in the hand of IW3C2 <em><strong>by the end of February of 2017</strong></em>.      </p>      <p> IW3C2 wants to use this opportunity to renew the publication of its        proceedings. The proceedings of the conference should fully embrace the        possibilities of the modern Web, and adapt to the new realities of        scholarly publishing. This means a list of new requirements that a        proceedings should fulfill in terms of its digital presence; details of        these requirements are <a href="#reqs">listed below</a>. IW3C2 is of        course open to intermediate discussions to discuss some of the details        and provide clarifications. </p>      <p> Regardless of whether IW3C2 to publishes the proceedings of its own        site, W3C2 may want to receive a copy of the proceedings for the purpose        of long-term archival. The bid should make it clear whether this is        acceptable or not. </p>    </section>    <section id="reqs">      <h2>Publishing Requirements</h2>      <p> The requirements are grouped into three categories: </p>      <ol>        <li><a href="#req-papers">Requirements for the individual papers</a></li>        <li><a href="#req-procs">Requirements for the proceedings as a whole</a></li>        <li><a href="#req-authors">Requirements for the workflow of paper            submissions</a></li>      </ol>      <p> For each of these categories the requirements are grouped into        absolute, strong, and “nice to have”. Absolute requirements are those        that IW3C2 wants to see fulfilled in any case. The other two are not        necessarily deal breakers, but may differentiate bids and influence the        final choice. </p>      <section id="req-papers">        <h3>Requirements for Individual Papers</h3>        <section>          <h4>Absolute Requirements</h4>          <ul>            <li>Each paper has its own DOI registered through services like              CrossRef.</li>            <li>The papers should be under open access of some sort; preferably              under CC0-BY copyright.</li>            <ul>              <li>In particular authors of the papers should have the right to                re-use their publication, with due reference to the published                version, in their research work, e.g., as part of their thesis                or other publications.</li>              <li>IW3C2 may accept to change its current copyright policy by                letting the publishers hold the copyright; this is open for                discussions during the final negotiations.</li>            </ul>            <li>Articles should be published in valid and accessible HTML5+CSS3.<br>              <ul>                <li>Extra resources, like extra CSS or JavaScript that are                  necessary for the proper presentation of the paper and                  provided by the authors, as well as embedded materials like                  figures, images, video, or audio <em>must</em> be stored                  locally on the publisher’s system alongside the paper itself.                  The goal is that the papers must stay readable as submitted                  for perpetuity.</li>                <li>Scripts should be restricted to provide facilities essential                  to the publication like interactive data display; it is                  acceptable if these are restricted to secure sandboxes (e.g.,                  iframe) for security reasons.</li>              </ul>            </li>            <li>Articles must be downloadable in EPUB3.1, including all the              media, and in PDF, possibly without the interactive media, i.e.,              only a print image.</li>            <ul>              <li>Should EPUB evolve in a few years (possibly under another                name) the publisher should be prepared to upgrade to the latest                standard eventually, based on an agreement with IW3C2. </li>            </ul>            <li>Easy access, via hyperlinks where applicable, to the usual              metadata (title, authors with their ORCID identifiers, DOI, etc.).</li>            <li>One-click tools to publish references to Twitter, Facebook,              Pocket, etc. should be integrated.</li>            <li>Usual citation exports (Zotero, Mendelay, BiBTeX, Endnote, etc.)              should be provided.</li>            <li>Easy download of the article metadata in a machine readable              format.
